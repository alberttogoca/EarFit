# Welcome

This is Earfit a webApp for my final degree project in  URJC. Earfit is an app for musical listening training based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). 

The idea is to develop an application to help musicians develop their hearing (musical ear training). For example, to identify intervals, scales, chord types, etc.
